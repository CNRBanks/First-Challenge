# Horiseon Home Page

## Description

My goal was to create a template of a home page for a Company that contains information on the services they provide.
This site allows users to see the services provided by the company and learn more about each type of service.

## Usage

Users can click on any of the three services listed in the top right hand side of the page and the site will automatically scroll the user to a section of the page that provides details on whichever service the user clicked.
